# Bilingual Audiobook maker tool

In the Colab notebook you can find the whole code to make a bilingual audiobook from an ebook in pdf format.
I uploaded the book that I used as an example. However the running takes a long time - for a 50-60 A4 pages book with GPU is ~3h+, without GPU it is significantly longer. I also not recommend to use CPU in Google Colab because due to inactivity in the notebook the connection can easily broke resulting artefatcs and truncated audio.
Here is whole audiobook in english - italian that have been copletely run on GPU and uploaded to my YouTube channel for easy access.
